### 21 Guns ###
Do you know what's worth fighting for? 
When it's not worth dying for? 
Does it take your breath away? 
And you feel yourself suffocating? 
Does the pain weigh out the pride? 

And you look for a place to hide? 

Did someone break your heart inside? 

You're in ruins 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky, 

You and I 



When you're at the end of the road 

And you lost all sense of control 

And your thoughts have taken their toll 

When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul. 



Your faith walks on broken glass 

And the hangover doesn't pass 

Nothing's ever built to last 

You're in ruins 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky, 

You and I 



Did you try to live on your own? 

When you burned down the house and home? 

Did you stand too close to the fire? 

Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone 



When it's time to live and let die 

And you can't get another try 

Something side this heart has died 

You're in ruins... 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky 



One, twenty-one guns 

Lay down your arms 

Give up the fight 

One, twenty-one guns 

Throw up your arms into the sky, 

You and I

### 2000 Light Years Away ###
I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and...

Dream about her

Cause she's 2000 light years away

She holds my malakite so tight so...

Never let go

Cause she's 2000 light years away

Years Away!



I sit outside and watch the sunrise

Lookout as far as I can

I can't see her, but in the distance

I hear some laughter,

We laugh together



I hold my breath and close my eyes and...

Dream about her

Cause she's 2000 light years away

She holds my malakite so tight so...

Never let go

Cause she's 2000 light years away

Years Away!



I sit alone in my bedroom

Staring at the walls

I've been up all damn night long

My pulse is speeding

My love is yearning



I hold my breath and close my eyes and...

Dream about her

Cause she's 2000 light years away

She holds my malakite so tight so...

Never let go

Cause she's 2000 light years away

### 80 ###
My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you
Everything she does questions my mental health

It makes me lose control

I wanna hurt myself



If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me

But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself

Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall



Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone

And lock myself up in a padded room

I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air

No one wants to hear a drunken fool



Everything she does questions my mental health

It makes me lose control

I just can't trust myself



If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me

But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself

Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall



I do not mind if this goes on

Cause now it seems I'm too far gone

I must admit I enjoy myself

80 please keep taking me away



Everything she does questions my mental health

It makes me lose control

I just can't trust myself



If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me

But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself

Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated

So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

### 86 ###
What brings you around?
Did you lose something the last time you were here?
You'll never find it now
It's buried deep with your identity
So stand aside and let the next one pass

Don't let the door kick you in the ass



There's no return from 86

There's no return from 86

There's no return from 86

Don't even try...



Exit out the back

And never show your head around again

Purchase your ticket 

And quickly take the last train out of town



So stand aside and let the next one pass

Don't ket the door kick you in the ass



There's no return from 86

There's no return from 86

There's no return from 86

Don't even try...



There's no return from 86

There's no return from 86

There's no return from 86

Don't even try...

### American Idiot ###
Don't wanna be an American idiot.
Don't want a nation under the new media.
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America.
Welcome to a new kind of tension.

All across the alienation.

Everything isn't meant to be okay.

Television dreams of tomorrow.

We're not the ones who're meant to follow.

For that's enough to argue.



Well maybe I'm the faggot America.

I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.

Now everybody do the propaganda.

And sing along in the age of paranoia.



Welcome to a new kind of tension.

All across the alienation.

Everything isn't meant to be okay.

Television dreams of tomorrow.

We're not the ones who're meant to follow.

For that's enough to argue.



Don't wanna be an American idiot.

One nation controlled by the media.

Information age of hysteria.

It's calling out to idiot America.

### Android ###
Hey old man in woman's shoes
I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams
Of wearing woman's shoes and being crazy?
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age

Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change



Or will I grow that old?

Will I still be around?

The way I carry on I'll end up

Six feet underground

And waste away...



When the old man was in school

Did the golden rule make him go crazy

Or did he hide away from hopes

Behind a smile and smoking dope

It's crazy



It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age

Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change



Or will I grow that old?

Will I still be around?

The way I carry on I'll end up

Six feet underground

And waste away...



It seems so frightening

Time passes by like lightning

Before you know it you're struck down

I always waste my time on my chemical emotions

It keeps my head spinning around

And waste away...



It seems so frightening

Time passes by like lightning

Before you know it you're struck down

I always waste my time on my chemical emotions

It keeps my head spinning around

And waste away...

### Are We the Waiting ###
Starry nights city lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown 
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found city bound in my dreams

And screaming 

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

And screaming

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting



Forget me nots and second thoughts live in isolation

Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

The rage and love, the story of my life

The Jesus of suburbia is a lie 



And screaming 

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

And screaming

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

And screaming

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown

### Armatage Shanks ###
Stranded...lost inside myself
My own worst friend
My own closest enemy
I'm Branded...maladjusted
Never trusted anyone
Let alone myself



I must insist

On being a pessimist

I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind



Elected the rejected

I perfected the science of the idiot

No meaning...no healing

Self loathing freak and introverted deviot



I must insist

On being a pessimist

I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind



Stranded...lost inside myself

My own worst friend

My own closest enemy

Elected the rejected

I perfected the science of the idiot



I must insist

On being a pessimist

I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind



I'm gettin' pissed

I'm a worthless pessimist

I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

### At the Library ###
Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey



Starting across the room

Are you leaving soon?

I just need a little time



What is it that drives me mad

Girls like you that I never had

What is it about you that I adore?

What makes me go so insane

That makes me feel so much pain

What is it about you that I adore?



Starting across the room

Are you leaving soon?

I just need a little time



Why did you have to leave so soon?

Why did you have to walk away?

Oh well it happened again

She walked away with her boyfriend

Maybe we'll meet again someday.

### Basket Case ###
Do you have the time 
to listen to me whine
About NOTHING and EVERYTHING
all at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools

Neurotic to the bone

No doubt about it



Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up

I think I'm CRACKING UP

Am I just PARANOID?

Or am I just STONED



I went to a shrink

To analyze my dreams

SHE says it's lack of sex

that's bringing me down

I went to a whore

HE said my life's a bore

So quit my whining cause

it's bringing HER down



Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up

I think I'm CRACKING UP

Am I just PARANOID?

Uh,yuh,yuh,ya



Grasping to CONTROL

So I BETTER hold on



Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up

I think I'm CRACKING UP

Am I just PARANOID?

Or am I just STONED

### Before the Lobotomy ###
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my family's from.
Singing

I can hear them singing.

When the rain had washed away

All these scattered dreams



Dying

Everyone's reminded

Hearts are washed in misery

Drenched in gasoline



Laughter

There is no more laughter

Songs of yesterday

Now live in the underground



Life before the lobotomy

Christian sang the eulogy

Sign my love a lost memory

From the end of the century



Well, it's enough to make you sick

To cast a stone and throw a brick

When the sky is falling down

It burned your dreams into the ground



Christian's lesson is what he's been sold

We are normal and self-controlled

Remember to learn to forget

Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes



Well I'm not stoned

I'm just fucked up

I got so high I can't stand up

I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed

I'm not in love 'cause I'm a mess



Like refugees

We're lost like refugees

Like refugees

We're lost like refugees

The brutality of reality

Is the freedom that keeps me from



Dreaming

I was only dreaming

Of another place and time

Where my family's from.



Singing

I can hear them singing.

When the rain had washed away

All these scattered dreams



Dying

Everyone's reminded

Hearts are washed in misery

Drenched in gasoline



Laughter

There is no more laughter

Songs of yesterday

Now live in the underground

Lyrics not found.

### Boulevard of Broken Dreams ###
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street

On the Boulevard of broken dreams

Where the city sleeps

And I'm the only one and I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk a.....



My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Till then I walk alone



Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah



I'm walking down the line

That divides me somewhere in my mind

On the border line of the edge

And where I walk alone



Read between the lines

What's fucked up and everything's all right

Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive

And I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk a...



My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Till then I walk alone



Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah

Ah-ah, ah-ah



I walk alone

I walk a



I walk this empty street

On the Boulevard of broken dreams

Where the city sleeps

And I'm the only one and I walk a



My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Till then I walk alone

### Brain Stew ###
I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
And still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind

On my own... here we go



My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed

Dried up and bulging out my skull

My mouth is dry

My face is numb

Fucked up and spun out in my room



On my own... here we go



My mind is set on overdrive

The clock is laughing in my face

A crooked spine

My sense dulled

Passed the point of delerium



On my own... here we go



My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed

Dried up and bulging out my skull

My mouth is dry

My face is numb

Fucked up and spun out in my room



On my own... here we go

### Brat ###
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days
They're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance

I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die

And got my inheritance



Now I want more

'Cause I'm getting bored

And I'm going nowhere fast

I was once filled with doubt

Now it's all figured out

Nothing good can last



Crows feet and rot are setting in

And time is running out

My parent's income interest rate

Is gaining higher clout

I'm a snot nosed slob

Without a job

And I know I damn well should

Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days

But my future's looking good



Now I want more

'Cause I'm getting bored

And I'm going nowhere fast

I was once filled with doubt

Now it's all figured out

Nothing good can last



Now I want more

'Cause I'm getting bored

And I'm going nowhere fast

I was once filled with doubt

Now it's all figured out

Nothing good can last

### Christie Road ###
Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly

Gotta get away

Or my brains will explode



Give me something to do to kill some time

Take me to that place that I call home

Take away the strains of being lonely

Take me to the tracks at Christie Road



See the hills from afar

Standing on my beat up car

The sun went down and the night fills the sky

Now I feel like me once again

As the train comes rolling in

Smoked my boredom gone

Slapped my brains up so high



Give me something to do to kill some time

Take me to that place that I call home

Take away the strains of being lonely

Take me to the tracks at Christie Road



Mother stay out of my way of that place we go

We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road



Mother stay out of my way of that place we go

We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road



If there's one thing that I need 

That makes me feel complete

So I go to Christie Road

It's home...

### Church on Sunday ###
Today is the first day
Of the rest of our lives
Tomorrow is too late
To pretend everything's all right
Well, I'm not getting any younger
As long as you don't get any older

I'm not going to state that yesterday

Never was



Bloodshot deadbeat

And lack of sleep

Making your mascara bleed

Tears down your face

Leaving traces of my mistakes



(When I say)

If I promise to go to church on Sunday

Will you go with me on Friday night?

If you live with me, I'll die for you

And this compromise



I hereby solemnly swear

To tell the whole truth

And nothing but the truth

Is what I'll ever hear from you

Trust is a dirty word

That comes from such a liar

But respect is something I will learn

If you have faith

### Coming Clean ###
Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well,Mom and Dad will never understand
Secrets collecting dust but never forget

SKELETONS come to LIFE in my closet



I found out what it takes to be a man

Well,Mom and Dad will never understand

WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME



Seventeen and COMING CLEAN for the first time

I finally figured out myself for the first time

I found out what it takes to be a man

Mom and Dad will never understand

WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME

### Deadbeat Holiday ###
Wake up, the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone
"Icon" is the last chance for hope
When there's no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in



Last chance to piss it all away

Nothing but hell to pay

When the lights are going down



Oh, deadbeat holiday

Celebrate your own decay

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

On a noose over your home

Oh, deadbeat holiday

Get on your knees and pray

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

But at least you're not alone



Christmas lights in the middle of August

Grudges come back to haunt us

Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies

Grounded in a duplex to find

That you're living on a landmine

Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive



Last chance to piss it all away

Nothing but hell to pay

When the lights are going down



Oh, deadbeat holiday

Celebrate your own decay

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

On a noose over your home

Oh, deadbeat holiday

Get on your knees and pray

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

But at least you're not alone



Last chance to piss it all away

Nothing but hell to pay

When the lights are going down



Oh, deadbeat holiday

Celebrate your own decay

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

On a noose over your home

Oh, deadbeat holiday

Get on your knees and pray

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

But at least you're not alone



Last chance to piss it all away

Nothing but hell to pay

When all you wanna do

Is not to give up



Oh, deadbeat holiday

Celebrate your own decay

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

On a noose over your home

Oh, deadbeat holiday

Get on your knees and pray

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

But at least you're not alone



Oh, deadbeat holiday

Celebrate your own decay

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

On a noose over your home

Oh, deadbeat holiday

Get on your knees and pray

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

But at least you're not alone



Oh, deadbeat holiday

Celebrate your own decay

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

On a noose over your home

Oh, deadbeat holiday

Get on your knees and pray

There's a vacant sign that's hanging high

But at least you're not alone

### Disappearing Boy ###
Now you see me, now you don't
Don't ask me where I'm at
'Cause I'm a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel
Don't say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won't see me again



Am I here or am I there

Or am I playing on the stairs

Am I in my room with my toys

I am the disappearing boy



When I walk in crowded rooms

I feel as if it is my doom

I know that I don't belong

In that room I see her

I see her and she's with him

I turn and then I'm gone



Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home

My whereabouts are now unknown

I vanished from all your joy

I'm the disappearing boy



I have my doubts

Of where I belong

It's something to think about



Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home

My whereabouts are now unknown

I vanished from all your joy

I'm the disappearing boy

### Dominated Love Slave ###
I want to be your dominated love slave
I want to be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave
Mack me in the forehead with a chain
Cause I love feelin' dirty

And I love feelin' cheap

And I love it when you hurt me

So drive them staples deep



I want you to slap me and call me naughty

Put a beltsander against my skin

I want to feel pain all over my body

Can't wait to be punished for my sins.



Cause I love feelin' dirty

And I love feelin' cheap

And I love it when you hurt me

So drive them staples deep



Yee-hah!



Cause I love feelin' dirty

And I love feelin' cheap

And I love it when you hurt me

So drrrriiiveeee.....Staples?

### Don't Leave Me ###
I'll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I've gone thru pain
Every day and night

I feel my mind is going insane

Something I can't fight



Don't leave me

Don't leave me



A blank expression

Covering your face

I'm looking for directions

For out of this place

I start to wonder

If you'll come back

I feel the rain storming after thunder

I can't hold back



Don't leave me



I'll go for miles

Till I find you

You say you want to leave me

But you can't choose

I've gone thru pain

Every day and night

I feel my mind is going insane

Something I can't fight



Don't leave me

### East Jesus Nowhere ###
Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized
Stand up! - all the white boys
Sit down! - all the black girls

You're the soldiers of the new world



Put your faith in a miracle

And it's non-denominational

Join the choir we will be singing

In the church of wishful thinking



A fire burns today

Of blasphemy and genocide

The sirens of decay

Will infiltrate the faith fanatics



Oh bless me lord for I have sinned

It's been a lifetime since I last confessed

I threw my crutches in "the river of a shadow of doubt"

And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best



Say a prayer for the family

Drop a coin for humanity

Ain't this uniform so flattering?

I never asked you for a goddamned thing



A fire burns today

Of blasphemy and genocide

The sirens of decay

Will infiltrate the faith fanatics



Don't test me

Second guess me

Protest me

You will disappear



I want to know who's allowed to breed

All the dogs who never learned to read

Missionary politicians

And the cops of a new religion



A fire burns today

Of blasphemy and genocide

The sirens of decay

Will infiltrate the inside

### Emenius Sleepus ###
I saw my friend the other day and I don't know
Exactly just what he became
It goes to show
It wasn't long ago
I was just like you
And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home



How have I been,how have you been

It's been so long

What have you done with all your time

And what went wrong



I knew you back when

And you ... you knew me

And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home



Anybody ever say no?

Ever tell you that you weren't right?

Where did all the little kid go?

Did you lose it in a hateful fight?

And you know it's true



It wasn't long ago

I was just like you

And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home

### Extraordinary Girl ###
She's
An Extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away
He

Lacks the courage in his mind

Like a child left behind

Like a pet left in the rain



She's all alone again

Wiping the tears from her eyes

Some days she feels like dying

She gets so sick of crying



She sees the mirror of herself

And image she wants to sell

To anyone willing to buy



He steals the image in her kiss

From her heart's apocalypse

From the one called whatsername



She's all alone again

Wiping the tears from her eyes

Some days she feels like dying

She gets so sick of crying



She's all alone again

Wiping the tears from her eyes

Some days she feels like dying

Some days it's not worth trying

Now that they've pulled the fun in

She gets so sick of crying



She's

An Extraordinary girl

An Extraordinary girl

An Extraordinary girl

An Extraordinary girl

### F.O.D. ###
Lyrics not found.

### Fashion Victim ###
He's a victim of his own time
In his vintage suit and tie
He's a casualty dressed to the teeth
In the latest genocide
The new seasons come and go
At the dog and pony show

Gonna sit and beg and fetch the names

And follow the dress codes



What's in a name, hey!



She's a scented magazine

Lookin sharp and livin clean

Livin well and dressed to kill

But she looks like hell to me

When you're dancing through your wardrobe

Do the anorex - a go-go

Cloaked with style for pedophiles

As the credit card explodes



Well you auctioned off your life

For the most expensive prize

Going once, going twice, it's gone



(youth crew)



What's in a name, hey!

What's in a name, hey!

What's in a name?

### Favorite Son ###
He hit the ground running,
At the speed of light.
The star was brightly shining,
Like a neon light.
It's your favorite son.

It's your favorite son.



A fixture on the talkshows,

To the silver screen.

From here to Colorado,

He's a sex machine.



It's your favorite son.

It's your favorite son.



But isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

It's pretty bloody sad,

but isn't it a drag?



A clean-cut All-American,

Really ain't so clean.

His royal auditorium,

Is a murder scene.



It's your favorite son.

It's your favorite son.



Oh, isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

It's pretty bloody sad,

but isn't it a drag?



Well no one says it's fair.

Turn a teenage lush,

To a millionaire.



Now where's your fuckin' champion?

On a bed you laid.

He's not the All-American,

That you thought you paid.



It's your favorite son.

It's your favorite son.

But isn't it a drag?

### Geek Stink Breath ###
I'm on a mission
I made my decision
To lead a path of self destruction
A slow progression
Killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth



I'm on a roll

No self control

I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine

Don't know what I want

That's all that I've got

And I'm picking scabs off my face



Every hour my blood is turning sour

And my pulse is beating out of time

I found a treasure

filled with sick pleasure

And it sits on a thick white line



I'm on a roll

No self control

I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine

Don't know what I want

That's all that I've got

And I'm picking scabs off my face



I'm on a mission

I've got no decision

Like a cripple running the rat race

Wish in one hand shit in the other

And see which one gets filled first



I'm on a roll

No self control

I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine

Don't know what I want

That's all that I've got

And I'm picking scabs off my face 



Geek..Stink.Breath!

### Give Me Novacaine ###
Take away the sensation inside
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind 
I can't take this feeling anymore
Drain the pressure from the swelling,
The sensations over whelming,

Give me a long kiss goodnight

and everything will be alright

Tell me that I won't feel a thing

So give me Novacaine

Out of body and out of mind

Kiss the demons out of my dreams

I get the funny feeling, that's alright 

Jimmy says it's better than here,

I'll tell you I

Drain the pressure from the swelling,

The sensations over whelming,

Give me a long kiss goodnight

and everything will be alright,

Tell me that I won't feel a thing,

So give me Novacaine

Drain the pressure from the swelling,

The sensations over whelming

Give me a long kiss goodnight

and everything will be alright,

Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing,

So give me Novacaine.

### Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) ###
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right.

I hope you had the time of your life.



So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind

Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time

Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial

For what it's worth it was worth all the while



It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. 

I hope you had the time of your life. 



It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. 

I hope you had the time of your life. 



It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. 

I hope you had the time of your life

### Green Day ###
A small cloud has fallen
The white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail
The rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red



Picture sounds

Of moving insects so surreal

Lay around

Looks like I found something new



Laying in my bed

I think I'm in left field

I picture someone, I think it's you

You're standing so damn close

My body begins to swell

Why does 1 + 1 make 2



Picture sounds

Of moving insects so surreal

Lay around

Looks like I found something new



Laying in my bed

I think I'm in left field

I picture someone, I think it's you

You're standing so damn close

My body begins to swell

Why does 1 + 1 make 2



Picture sounds

Of moving insects so surreal

Lay around

### Haushinka ###
Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name. 
I met her on the eve of my birthday. 
Did she know, did she know, before she went away, does she know? But it's too damn late 
This girl has gone far away. 
Now she's gone. 



All I have now is a memory to date. 

A cheap hat and cigarettes, and a peculiar name. 

I didn't know, I didn't know, before she went away. 

I know now, I know now, and it's too damn late. 



Will she ever find her way? 

I'm too damn young to be too late, but am I? 

Yet again I'm kicking myself, and I'll be here in battle scars, waiting for you. 

Waiting for you now.

### Hitchin' a Ride ###
Hey mister, where you headed? 
Are you in a hurry? 
I need a lift to happy hour. 
Say oh no. 
Do you brake for distilled spirits? 
I need a break as well. 

The well that inebriates the guilt. 

1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. 



Cold turkey's getting stale, tonight I'm eating crow. 

Fermented salmonella poison oak no 



There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrating. 

My tongue is swelling up, as say 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. 



Troubled times, you know i can not lie. 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride. 



There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrating. 

My tongue is swelling up, I say Shit! 



Troubled times, you know I can not lie. 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride. 



I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

### Hold On ###
My mental stability reaches its bitter end
As I step to the edge
Of a shadow of a doubt
With my conscience beating
Like the pulse of a drum
that hammers on and on

As I reach the break of day

As the sun beats down

On the halfway house

Has my conscience beating

The sound in my ear

The will to persevere

As I reach the break of day



When you've lost all hope

And excuses

And the cheapskates and the losers

Nothing's left to cling on to

You gotta hold on...

Hold on to yourself



A cry of hope, a plea for peace

And my conscience beating

It's not what I want

For it's all that I need

To reach the break of day

So I run to the edge

Beyond the shadow of a doubt

With my conscience bleeding

Here lies the truth

The lost treasures of my youth

As i hold to the break of day

### Holiday ###
Say, Hey! 
Hear the sound of the falling rain 
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!) 
The shame 
The ones who died without a name 



Hear the dogs howling out of key 

To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!) 

And bleed, the company lost the war today 



I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 

On holiday 



Hear the drum pounding out of time 

Another protestor has crossed the line (Hey!) 

To find, the money's on the other side 



Can I get another Amen? (Amen!) 

There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!) 

A gag, a plastic bag on a monument 



I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 

On holiday 



(Hey!) 

(Say, Hey!) 



"The representative from California has the floor" 



Zieg Heil to the president gasman 

Bombs away is your punishment 

Pulverize the Eiffel towers 

Who criticize your government 

Bang bang goes the broken glass and 

Kill all the fags that don't agree 

Trials by fire, setting fire 

Is not a way that's meant for me 

Just cause, just cause, because we're outlaws yeah! 



I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies 

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives 



This is our lives on holiday

### Homecoming ###
[Part 1: The death of St. Jimmy]
My heart is beating from me
I am standing all alone
Please call me only if you are coming home
Waste another year flies by

Waste a night or two

You taught me how to live

In the streets of shame

Where you've lost your dreams in the rain

There's no signs of hope

The stems and seeds of the last of the dope

There's a glow of light

The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night

Bearing gifts and trust

The fixture in the city of lust

What the hell's your name?

What's your pleasure and what's your pain?

Do you dream to much?

Do you think what you need is a crutch?

In the crowd of pain. St. Jimmy comes without any shame

He says ?we're fucked up?

But we're not the same

And mom and dad are the ones you can blame



Jimmy died today



He blew his brains out into the bay 

In the state of mind it's my own private suicide



[Part 2: East 12th St.]



Well nobody cares

Well nobody cares

Does anyone care if nobody cares?

Well nobody cares

Well nobody cares

Does anyone care if nobody cares?



Jesus filling out paperwork now

At the facility on east 12th st.

He's not listening to a word now

He's in his own world

And he's daydreaming



He'd rather be doing something else now,

Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly,

His life's on the line with anxiety now,

And she had enough,

And he had plenty



Somebody get me out of here

Anybody get me out of here

Somebody get me out of here

Get me the fuck right out of here



So far away

I don't want to stay

Get me out of here right now

I just wanna be free

Is there a possibility?

Get me out of here right now

This life like dream ain't for me



[Part 3: Nobody likes you!]



I fell asleep while watching spike TV

After 10 cups of coffee

And you're still not here

Dreaming of a song

But something went wrong

And I can't tell anyone

'Cause no one's here

Left me here alone

And I should have stayed home

After 10 cups of coffee I'm thinking 

(where'd you go?)

Nobody likes you, everyone left you

(where'd you go?)

They're all out without you havin' fun

(where'd you go?)

Everyone left you, nobody likes you

(where'd you go?)

They're all out without you havin' fun

(where'd you go..go..go..go..)



[Part 4: Rock and roll girlfriend]



I got a rock and roll band

I got a rock and roll life 

I got a rock and roll girlfriend

And another ex-wife

I got a rock and roll house

I got a rock and roll car

I play the shit out the drums

And I can play the guitar

I got a kid in New York

I got a kid in the bay

I haven't drank or smoked nothin'

In over 22 days (Don't wanna be an American idiot)

So get off my case

Off of my case

Off of my case!



[Part 5: We're coming home again]



Here they come marching down the street

Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat

Coming back from the edge of town

Underneath their feet

The time has come and it going nowhere

Nobody ever said that life was fair now

Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear

In the summer heat

The world is spinning

Around and around

Out of control again

From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down

To send my love a letterbomb

And visit me in hell

We're the ones going



Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again



I started fuckin' running

As soon as my feet touched the ground

We're back in the Barrio

But to you and me, that's jingle town



Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again

Home

We're coming home again



Nobody likes you

Everyone left you

They're all out without you havin' fun

### Horseshoes and Handgrenades ###
I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
I think we've got a bleeder right now
Want you to slap me around
Want you to knock me out

Well, you missed me, kissed me

Now you better kick me down



Maybe you're the runner-up

But the first one to lose the race

Almost only really counts in

Horseshoes and hand grenades



I'm gonna burn it all down

I'm gonna rip it out

Well, everything that you employ

Was meant for me to destroy

To the ground now

So don't you fuck me around

Because I'll shoot you down

I'm gonna drink, fight, and fuck

And pushing my luck

All the time now



Maybe you're the runner-up

But the first one to lose the race

Almost only really counts in

Horseshoes and hand grenades



Demolition, self-destruction

What to annihilate

The age-old contradiction

Demolition, self-destruction

What to annihilate

The old age



I'm not fucking around

I think I'm coming out

All the deceivers and cheaters

I think we've got a bleeder right now

I'm not fucking around

G-L-O-R-I-A

### I Fought the Law ###
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 
I needed the money 'cause I had none 
I fought the law and the law won 
I fought the law and the law won 



I miss my baby and I feel so sad

I guess my race is run 

Well she's the best girl that I ever had 

I fought the law and the law won 

I fought the law and the



Robin' people with a six gun 

I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and I miss my fun

I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the law won



I miss my baby and I feel so sad

I guess my race is run

Well she's the best girl that I ever had

I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the



I fought the law and the law won [x7]

I fought the law and the

### I Want to Be Alone ###
I lock myself inside my room
I WANNA BE ALONE
With you around, you'll only add on
I WANNA BE ALONE
Its been disturbed by my thoughts
I WANNA BE ALONE

With you around, you'll only add on

I WANNA BE ALONE



Please don't think I'm crazy

I don't want you to understand

My mind is growing hazy

To hell with your helping hand

Why don't you just leave me alone

This conflict is my own

Keep your sources away from me

That's all



I lock myself inside my room

I WANNA BE ALONE

With you around, you'll only add on

I WANNA BE ALONE

Its been disturbed by my thoughts

I WANNA BE ALONE



With you around, you'll only add on

I WANNA BE ALONE



Please don't think I'm crazy

I don't want you to understand

My mind is growing hazy

To hell with your helping hand

Why don't you just leave me alone

This conflict is my own

Keep your sources away from me

That's all



I lock myself inside my room

I WANNA BE ALONE

With you around, you'll only add on

I WANNA BE ALONE

My mind is growing hazy

To hell with your helping hand

Why don't you just leave me alone

### I Want to Be on TV ###
Wanna be a TV boy.
Wanna be on Solid Gold.
Wanna date a millonaire.
Wanna make people stare.
I wanna be on TV.

Want people to know me.

I wanna be on TV.



Started out in 54

Gonna be an omnivore.

Wanna make people dance.

Gonna take off my pants.



I wanna be on TV.

Want people to know me.

I wanna be on TV.



On a magazine.

Gonna have some free cocaine.

Wanna wear my Calvin Kleins.

Then the world will be all mine.



I wanna be on TV.

Want people to know me.

I wanna be on TV.

### In the End ###
All brawn and no brains 
And all those nice things
You FINALLY got what you want
Someone to look good with
AND light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?



I figured out what you're all about

And I don't think I like what I see

SOOOOO ...

I HOPE I won't be there in the end 

if you come around.



How long will he last

Before he's a CREEP in the past

And you're alone once again?

Will you pop up AGAIN and be my

"SPECIAL FRIEND" 'till the end?

And when will that be?



I figured out what you're all about

And I don't think I like what I see

SOOOOO ...

I HOPE I won't be there in the end

if you come around.



I figured out what you're all about

And I don't think I like what I see

SOOOOO ...

I HOPE I won't be there in the end

if you come around.

### J.A.R. (Jason Andrew Relva) ###
Lyrics not found.

### Jackass ###
To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
Well I don't mind
If you don't mind
Hell, I am not the one that's gonna die

I guess I just can't listen

To this one-sided conversation again

Well I don't care

If I don't care

No one ever said that life was fair



Well everybody loves a joke

But no one likes a fool

And you're always crackin

The same old lines again

You're well rehearsed on every verse

And that was stated clear

But no one understands your verity



The center of attention

And an honorable mention once again

Congratulations

And salutations

You're a figment of your own imagination



To know you is to bait you

And you fell victim to your own denial

Well I don't mind

If you dont mind

You're was...ting...all...your...time

### Jaded ###
Somebody keep my balance
I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date
Rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank



Always move forward

Going "straight" will get you nowhere

There is no progress

Evolution killed it all

I found my place in nowhere



I'm taking one step sideways

Leading with my crutch

Got a fucked up equilibrium

Count down from 9 to 5

Hooray! We're gonna die!

Blessed into our extinction



Always move forward

Going "straight" will get you nowhere

There is no progress

Evolution killed it all

I found my place in nowhere



Always move forward

Going "straight" will get you nowhere

There is no progress

Evolution killed it all

I found my place in nowhere

### Jesus of Suburbia ###
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of suburbia 
From the bible of none of the above 
On a steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin 
No one ever died for my sins in hell 
As far as I can tell 

At least the ones I got away with 



And there's nothing wrong with me 

This is how I'm supposed to be 

In a land of make believe 

That don't believe in me



Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix 

The living room or my private womb 

While the moms and brads are away 

To fall in love and fall in debt 

To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane 

To keep me insane and doing someone else's cocaine



And there's nothing wrong with me

This is how I'm supposed to be

In a land of make believe

That don't believe in me



At the center of the Earth

In the parking lot 

Of the 7-11 were I was taught 

The motto was just a lie 

It says home is where your heart is

But what a shame 

Cause everyone's heart 

Doesn't beat the same 

It's beating out of time 



City of the dead 

At the end of another lost highway 

Signs misleading to nowhere 

City of the damned 

Lost children with dirty faces today 

No one really seems to care 



I read the graffiti 

In the bathroom stall 

Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall 

And so it seemed to confess 

It didn't say much 

But it only confirmed that

The center of the earth 

Is the end of the world 

And I could really care less 



City of the dead

At the end of another lost highway

Signs misleading to nowhere

City of the damned

Lost children with dirty faces today

No one really seems to care



I don't care if you don't 

I don't care if you don't

I don't care if you don't care

[x4]



I don't care



Everyone is so full of shit 

Born and raised by hypocrites 

Hearts recycled but never saved

From the cradle to the grave 

We are the kids of war and peace

From Anaheim to the middle east 

We are the stories and disciples 

Of the Jesus of suburbia 

Land of make believe 

And it don't believe in me 

Land of make believe 

And I don't believe 

And I don't care! 

I don't care! I don't care!

I don't care! I don't care!



Dearly beloved are you listening?

I can't remember a word that you were saying

Are we demented or am I disturbed? 

The space that's in between insane and insecure 

Oh therapy, can you please fill the void? 

Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed 

Nobody's perfect and I stand accused 

For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse 



To live and not to breathe 

Is to die In tragedy

To run, to run away 

To find what you believe 

And I leave behind

This hurricane of fucking lies 

I lost my faith to this 

This town that don't exist



So I run 

I run away

To the light of masochist

And I leave behind 

This hurricane of fucking lies

And I walked this line 

A million and one fucking times

But not this time



I don't feel any shame

I won't apologize 



When there ain't nowhere you can go

Running away from pain

When you've been victimized

Tales from another broken home



You're leaving...

You're leaving...

You're leaving...

Ah you're leaving home...

### King for a Day ###
Started at the age of four. 
My mother went to the grocery store. 
Went sneaking throught her bedroom door to find something in a size four. 
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls. 
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the one and only. 



King for a day, princess by dawn. 

King for a day in a leather thong. 

King for a day, princess by dawn. 

Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me. 



My daddy threw me in therapy. 

He thinks I'm not a real man. 

Who put the drag in the drag queen. 

Don't knock it until you tried it 



Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls. 

GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the one and only.



King for a day, princess by dawn. 

King for a day in a leather thong. 

King for a day, princess by dawn. 

Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me. 



Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls.

Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy



Do you know the enemy?

Do you know your enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy



Violence is an energy

Against your urgency

So rally up the demons of your soul



Do you know the enemy?

Do you know your enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy



Do you know the enemy?

Do you know your enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy



The insurgency will rise

When the blood's been sacrificed

Don't be blinded by the lies

In your eyes.



Violence is an energy

From here to eternity

Violence is an energy

Silence is the enemy

So gimme, gimme revolution



Do you know the enemy?

Do you know your enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy



Do you know the enemy?

Well, gotta know the enemy



Overthrow the effigy

The vast majority

Burning down the foreman of control



Silence is the enemy

Against your urgency

So rally up the demons of your soul

### Last Night on Earth ###
I text a postcard, sent to you
Did it go through?
Sending all my love to you.
You are the moonlight of my life every night
Giving all my love to you
My beating heart belongs to you

I walked for miles 'til I found you

I'm here to honor you

If I lose everything in the fire

I'm sending all my love to you.



With every breath that I am worth

Here on Earth

I'm sending all my love to you.

So if you dare to second guess

You can rest assured

That all my love's for you



My beating heart belongs to you

I walked for miles 'til I found you

I'm here to honor you

If I lose everything in the fire

I'm sending all my love to you.



My beating heart belongs to you

I walked for miles 'til I found you

I'm here to honor you

If I lose everything in the fire

Did I ever make it through?

### Last of the American Girls ###
She puts her makeup on
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies
Right in her hand
She is paranoid like
Endangered species headed into extinction

She is one of a kind

She's the last of the American girls



She wears her overcoat

For the coming of the nuclear winter

She is riding her bike

Like a fugitive of critical mass

She's on a hunger strike

For the ones who won't make it for dinner

She makes enough to survive

For a holiday of working class



She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated.

She won't cooperate

She's the last of the American girls



She plays her vinyl records

Singing songs on the eve of destruction

She's a sucker for

All the criminals breaking the laws

She will come in first

For the end of western civilization

She's an endless war

She's a hero for the lost cause

Like a hurricane

In the heart of the devastation

She's a natural disaster

She's the last of the American girls



She puts her makeup on

Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland

She's got her little book of conspiracies

Right in her hand

She will come in first

For the end of western civilization

She's a natural disaster

She's the last of the American girls

### Letterbomb ###
Nobody likes you...
Everyone left you...
They're all out without you...
Having fun...
Where have all the bastards gone?

The underbelly stacks up ten high

The dummy failed the crash test

Collecting unemployment checks

Like a flunkie along for the ride



Where have all the riots gone

As the city's motto gets pulverized?

What's in love is now in debt

On your birth certificate

So strike the fucking match to light this fuse!



The town bishop is an extortionist

And he don't even know that you exist

Standing still when it's do or die

You better run for your fucking life



It's not over 'till you're underground

It's not over before it's too late

This city's burnin'

It's not my burden

It's not over before it's too late



There's nothing left to analyze



Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?

And where will we all go when it's too late?



And don't look back



You're not the Jesus of Suburbia

The St. Jimmy is a figment of

Your father's rage and your mother's love

Made me the idiot of America



It's not over 'till you're underground

It's not over before it's too late

This city's burnin'

It's not my burden

It's not over before it's too late



She said I can't take this place

I'm leaving it behind



Well she said I can't take this town

I'm leaving you tonight

### Longview ###
Sit around and watch the tube,but nothing's on
Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving

I sure as hell can't do it by myself

I'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT

Barred indoors from the summer street

I locked the door to MY OWN CELL

And I lost the key



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!

And I smell like shit



I GOT NO MOTIVATION

WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION

NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION

SMOKING MY INSPIRATION



Sit around and watch the phone,but no one's calling

Call me pathetic,call me WHAT YOU WILL

My mother says to get a job

But she don't like the one SHE'S got

When mastur bation's lost its fun

You're fucking lazy



Bite my lip and close my eyes

Take me away to paradise

I'm so damn BORED

I'm going blind

And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes

I was slipping away to paradise

Some say,"Quit or I'll go BLIND."

But it's just a myth

### Macy's Day Parade ###
Today's the Macy's Day Parade
the night of the living dead is on its way
with a credit report for duty call
it's a lifetime guarantee
stuffed in a coffin 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum



Give me something that I need

satisfaction guaranteed to you

what's the consolation prize?

economy sized dreams of hope



when I was a kid I thought

I wanted all the things that I haven't got

oh. I learned the hardest way

Then I realized what it took

To tell the difference between

thieves and crooks

A lesson learned to me and you



Give me something that I need

Satisfaction guaranteed

Because I'm thinking about

a brand new hope

the one I've never known

cause now I know

it's all that I wanted



what's the consolation prize?

economy sized dreams of hope 

Give me something that I need

Satisfaction guaranteed 

Because I'm thinking about

a brand new hope

the one I've never known

and where it goes

and I'm thinking about

the only road

the one I've never known

and where it goes



Because I'm thinking about 

a brand new hope

the one I've never known 

cause now I know

it's all that I wanted

### Maria ###
She smashed the radio
with the board of education
turn up the static left of 
the state of the nation
Turn up the flame

step on the gas

burning the flag at half mast

she's a rebel's forgotten son

an export of the revolution



She is the first voice

of the last ones in the line

she'll drag the lake

to keep the vendetta alive



Bring in the head of the government

the dog ate the document

somebody shot the President

and no one knows where Maria went?



Maria,

Maria,

Maria, where did you go?...



Be careful what your offering

your breath lacks the conviction

drawing the line in the dirt

because the last decision.. is no!

### Minority ###
I want to be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I want to be the minority
I pledge allegiance to the underworld

One nation under dog

There of which I stand alone

A face in the crowd

Unsung, against the mold

Without a doubt

Singled out

The only way I know



'Cause I want to be the minority

I don't need your authority

Down with the moral majority

'Cause I want to be the minority



Stepped out of the line

Like a sheep runs from the herd

Marching out of time

To my own beat now

The only way I know



One light, one mind

Flashing in the dark

Blinded by the silence 

of a thousand broken hearts

"For crying out loud" 

she screamed unto me

A free for all

F*** 'em all

You are your own sight



'Cause I want to be the minority

I don't need your authority

Down with the moral majority

'Cause I want to be the minority



(Instrumental)



One light, one mind

Flashing in the dark

Blinded by the silence 

of a thousand broken hearts

"For crying out loud" 

she screamed unto me

A free for all

F*** 'em all

You are your own sight



'Cause I want to be the minority

I don't need your authority

Down with the moral majority

'Cause I want to be the minority



I want to be the minority

I want to be the minority

I want to be the minority

I want to be the minority

### Misery ###
Virginia was a lot lizard from F.L.A.
She had a compund fracture in the trunk
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to Misery

Mr. Whirly had a catastrophic incident

He fell into the city by the bay

He liquidated his estate

Now he sleeps up on the Haight

Panhandling Misery



And he's gonna get high high high

When he's low low low

The fire burns from better days

And she screams why oh why

I said I don't know

The catastrophic hymns from yesterday

Of Misery



Well Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam

He ran the drug cartel in Tinsel Town

They found him in a Cadillac

Bludgeoned with a baseball bat

In the name of Misery



Then Gina hit the road to New York City

Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked

She stopped in Vegas to elope

With Virginia and a dope

Who kissed the bride eternally



And they're gonna get high high high

When they're low low low

The fire burns from better days

And she screams why oh why

I said I don't know

The catastrophic hymns from yesterday

Of Misery



Well hell's hounds on your trail now once again, boy

It's groping on your leg until it sleeps

The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow

'Cuz it's not what you make, it's what you leave



And we're gonna get high high high

When we're low low low

The fire burns from better days

And she screams why oh why

I said I don't know

The catastrophic hymns from yesterday

Of Misery

### Nice Guys Finish Last ###
Nice guys finish last
You're running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you're at your best
When you feel the worst
You feel washed up like piss gone down the drain

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane

I'm so fucking happy I could cry

Every joke can have its truth but now the joke's on you

I never knew you're such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last

When you are the outcast

Don't pat yourself on the back

You might break your spine

Living on command

You're shaking lots of hands

You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust

Taking what you need

Bite the hand that feeds

You lose your memory and you've got no shame

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane

I'm so fucking happy I could cry

Every joke can have its truth but now the joke's on you

I never knew you're such a funny guy

Oh nice guys finish last

When you are the outcast

Don't pat yourself on the back

You might break your spine

Oh nice guys finish last

When you are the outcast

Don't pat yourself on the back

You might break your spine

Oh nice guys finish last

When you are the outcast

Don't pat yourself on the back

You might break your spine

Oh nice guys finish last

When you are the outcast

Don't pat yourself on the back

You might break your spine

### No One Knows ###
Why should my fun have to end?
For me it's only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to what end
Call me irresponsible

Call me habitual

But when you think of me

Do you fill your head with schemes

Better think again

Cause no one knows



I don't want to cause no harm

But sometimes my actions hurt

Is there something I should find

To make plans for forever



Call me irresponsible

Call me habitual

But when you think of me

Do you fill your head with schemes

Better think again

Cause no one knows



Call me irresponsible

Call me habitual

But when you think of me

Do you fill your head with schemes

Better think again

Cause no one knows



Does it seem like all your memories fade

You soak up knowledge to fill the space

And still my answer remains...

I don't know

### Nuclear Family ###
Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a Ferris wheel like it's breaking down
Drinking angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action so gimme my turn
Like a Chinese company conspiracy

It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you

It's looking like another bad comedy

Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too



Can you hear the sound coming over the hill?

Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill

Ba-baby, baby it's a blow out, wow yeah

Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate



Like a Chinese company conspiracy

It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you

It's looking like another bad comedy

Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too



Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round

Like a Ferris wheel like it's breaking down

Scream, screaming, screaming bloody murder

Like a nuclear bomb and it won't be long 'til I detonate



Like a Chinese company conspiracy

It's the death of a nuclear family staring up at you

It's looking like another bad comedy

Just as long as it comes in hi-fidelity for me too



Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three

5-4-3-2-1

### One for the Razorbacks ###
Juliet's trying to find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Look this direction, I know it's not perfection, it's just me...
I want to bring you up again now
Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity

A small price to pay to see that you're happy

Forget all the disappointments you have faced

Open up your worried world and let me in



Juliet's crying cause now she's realizing love can be

Filled with pain and distrust

I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy

But I will try to bring you up again now



Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity

A small price to pay to see that you're happy

Forget all the disappointments you have faced

Open up your worried world and let me in



Juliet's crying cause now she's realizing love can be

Filled with pain and distrust

I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy

But I will try to bring you up again some how



Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity

A small price to pay to see that you're happy

Forget all the disappointments you have faced

Open up your worried world and let me in

### Only of You ###
I wish I could tell you
But the words would come out wrong
Oh if you only knew
The way I felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care

These feelings in my heart

Only with you I want to share



The first time I caught a glimpse of you

Then all my thoughts were only of you



I hope that when time goes by

You will think the same about me

Many nights awake I lie

I only wish that you could see

I know that we're only friends

I hope this feeling never ends

If I could only hold you

It's the only thing I want to do.



The first time I caught a glimpse of you

Then all my thoughts were only of you

### Panic Song ###
Ready for a cheap escape
On the brink of self destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of
Anguish... mass confusion



The world is a sick machine

Breeding a mass of shit

With such a desolate conclusion

Fill the void with... I don't care



There's a plague inside of me

Eating at my disposition

Nothing's left

Torn out of reality

Into a state of no opinion

Limp with hate



The world is a sick machine

Breeding a mass of shit

With such a desolate conclusion

Fill the void with... I don't care



I WANNA JUMP OUT!!!

### Paper Lanterns ###
Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest

But now and then I'll see you again

And it puts my heart to the test



So when are all my troubles going to end?

I'm understanding now that

We are only friends

To this day I'm asking why

I still think about you



As the days go on I wonder

(Will this ever end?)

I find it hard to keep control

When you're with your boyrfriend

I do not mind if all I am is

Just a friend to you

But all I want to know right now

Is if you think about me too... ?



So when are all my problems going to end?

I'm understanding now that

We are only friends

To this day I'm asking why

I still think about you



So when are all my problems going to end?

I'm understanding now that

We are only friends

To this day I'm asking why

I still think about you

### Peacemaker ###
Well, I've got a fever
A non-believer
I'm in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar
I'm gonna seize the day
Well, call of the banshee, hey hey

Hey hey hey hey hey

As God as my witness

The infidels are gonna pay



Well, call the assassin

The orgasm

A spasm of love and hate

For what will divide us?

The righteous and the meek

Well, call of the wild, hey hey

Hey hey hey hey hey

Death to the girl at the end of the serenade



Vendetta, sweet vendetta

This beretta of the night

This fire and the desire

Shots ringing out on a holy parasite



I am a killjoy from Detroit

I drink from a well of rage

I feed off the weakness with all my love

Call up the captain, hey hey

Hey hey hey hey hey

Death to the lover that you were dreaming of



This is a stand-off

A Molotov cocktail

On the house

You thought I was a write-off

You better think again

Call the peacemaker, hey hey

Hey hey hey hey hey

I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began



Vendetta, sweet vendetta

This beretta of the night

This fire and the desire

Shots ringing out on a holy parasite



Well now the caretaker's the undertaker

Now I'm gonna go out and get the peacemaker

This is the Neo St. Valentine's massacre

Well call up the Gaza, hey hey

Hey hey hey hey hey

Death to the ones at the end of the serenade

Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade

Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade

Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade

### Platypus (I Hate You) ###
From Billie Joe: The lyrics to "Platypus" will not be on the Cd because of lawyer problems due to my potty mouth. But here they are anyway: 
Your rise and fall 
Back up against the wall 
What goes around is coming back and haunting you 
It's time to quit 

Cause you ain't worth the shit 

Under my shoes or the piss on the ground 



No one loves you and you know it 

Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care 

Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want 

to hear. 

I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU 



I heard your sick 

Sucked on that cancer stick 

A throbbing tumor and a radiation high 

Shit out of luck 

And now your time is up 

It brings me pleasure just to know your going to die 



Dickhead, Fuckface, cock smoking, mother fucking, asshole,

dirty twat, waste of semen, I hope you die HEY 



Red eye, code blue 

I'd like to strangle you 

And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull 

When you go down 

Head first into the ground 

I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave

### Poprocks & Coke ###
Wherever you go
You know I'll be there
If you go far,
You know I'll be there
I'll go anywhere,
So I'll see you there

You place the name

You know I'll be there

You name the time

You know I'll be there

I'll go anywhere

So I'll see you there



I don't care if you don't mind

I'll be there not far behind

I will dare

Keep in mind

I'll be there for you



Where there's truth

You know I'll be there

Amongst the lies

You know I'll be there

I'll go anywhere

So I'll see you there



I don't care if you don't mind

I'll be there not far behind

I will dare

Keep in mind

I'll be there for you



If you should fall

You know I'll be there

To catch the call

You I'll be there

I'll go anywhere

So I'll see you there



I don't care if you don't mind

I'll be there not far behind

I will dare

Keep in mind

I don't care

I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you

### Prosthetic Head ###
I see you, down in the front line. 
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover. 
Plastic eyes, lookin' through a numbskull. 
Self-effaced, what's his face. 
You erased yourself so shut up. 
You don't let up. 



You have a growth that must be treated 

Like a severed severe pain in the neck. 

You can smell it but you can't see it. 

No explanation identified 'cause you don't know. 

You don't say. 



And you got no reply. 

Hey you, where did you come from? 

Got a head full of lead, you're a inbred bastard son. 

All dressed up, red blooded, Amannequin 

Do or die, no reply, don't deny that you're synthetic. 

You're pathetic.

### Pulling Teeth ###
I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
But this time I can't get up
She comes to check on me
MAKING sure I'm on my knees

After all she's the one

Who put me in this STATE



Is she ULTRA-VIOLENT?

Is she DISTURBED?

I better tell her that I LOVE her

Before she does it all over again

OH GOD,SHE'S KILLING ME!!!



For now I'll lie around

HELL, that's all I can really do

She takes good care of me

Just keep saying my LOVE is TRUE



Is she ULTRA-VIOLENT?

Is she DISTURBED?

I better tell her that I LOVE her

Before she does it all over again

OH GOD,SHE'S KILLING ME!!!



Looking out my window for

Someone that's passing by

No one knows I'm LOCKED in here

All I do is cry



For now I'll lie around

HELL, that's all I can really do

She takes good care of me

Just keep saying my LOVE is TRUE

### Redundant ###
We're living in repetition. 
Content in the same old shtick again. 
Now the routine's turning to contention, 
Like a production line going over and over and over, roller coaster. 
Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice. 

I'm speechless and redundant. 

'Cause I love you's not enough. 

I'm lost for words. 



Choreographed and lack of passion. 

Prototypes of what we were. 

Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous. 

Taken for granted now. 

Now I waste it, faked it, ate it, now i hate it. 



Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice. 

I'm speechless and redundant, 'cause I love you's not enough. 

I'm lost for words, now I cannot speak.

### Restless Heart Syndrome ###
I've got a really bad disease 
It's got me begging 
On my hands and knees 
So take me to the emergency 
'Cause something seems to be missing 
Somebody take the pain away 

It's like an ulcer bleeding in my brain 

So send me to the pharmacy 

So I can lose my memory 

I'm elated 

Medicated 

Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away. 



I think they found another cure 

For broken hearts and feeling insecure 

You'd be surprised what I endure 

What makes you feel so self-assured? 



I need to find a place to hide 

You never know what could be 

Waiting outside 

The accidents that you could find 

It's like some kind of suicide 



So what ails you is what impales you 

I feel like I've been crucified to be satisfied 



I'm a victim of my symptom 

I am my own worst enemy 

You're a victim of your symptom 

You are your own worst enemy 

Know your enemy. 



I'm elated 

Medicated 

I am my own worst enemy 

So what ails you is what impales you 

You are your own worst enemy 

You're a victim of the system 

You are your own worst enemy 

You're a victim of the system 

You are your own worst enemy

### Revolution Radio ###
Scream with your hands up in the sky, like you want to testify
For the life that's been deleted, sing like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes, for the lost souls that were cheated
We will be seen but not be heard
We are, revolution radio

Operation no control

And the headline, my love's bullet proof

Give me cherry bombs and gasoline

Debutantes in surgery

And the headline, legalize the truth



Give me rage like there's teargas in the crowd

Do you want to live out loud? but the air is barely breathing

Rise of the slums to the obsolete

The dawn of the new airwaves for the anti-social media



We are, revolution radio

Operation no control

And the headline, my love's bullet proof

Give me cherry bombs and gasoline

Debutantes in surgery

And the headline, legalize the truth



We will be seen but not be heard

We are the songs of the disturbed



We are, revolution radio

Operation no control

And the headline, my love's bullet proof

Give me cherry bombs and gasoline

Debutantes in surgery

And the headline, legalize the truth

### Road to Acceptance ###
I always waste my time just wondering
What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance
I always waste my time just wondering

What the next man thinks of me

I'll never do exactly what I want

And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance



And I feel forgotten

Feel like rotting

(Do you feel the same?)

(Do you feel the same?)

Adolescence

Just can't make sense

(It's calling my name)

(It's calling my name)



I take a look around

And all the things I've found

I call it blind hatred

If you'd stop a while

And maybe if you'd smile

You would realize that

We're all the same



It's just like our brain

When it apes insane

We feel the same pain



All my life I've seemed to have this need

I think at times it even turns to greed

We all want to join some family

We'll even sacrifice a moral changing



And I feel forgotten

Feel like rotting

(Do you feel the same?)

(Do you feel the same?)

Adolescence

Just can't make sense

(It's calling my name)

(It's calling my name)



I take a look around

And all the things I've found

I call it blind hatred

If you'd stop a while

And maybe if you'd smile

You would realize that

We're all the same



It's just like our brain

When it apes insane

We feel the same pain



I take a look around

And all the things I've found

I call it blind hatred

If you'd stop a while

And maybe if you'd smile

You would realize that

We're all the same



It's just like our brain

When it apes insane

We feel the same pain

### Scattered ###
I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor. 
Reminds me of the times we shared. 
Makes me wish that you were here. 
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life.
All the songs have been erased. 
Guess I've learned from my mistakes. 



Open the past and present. 

Now and we are there. 

Story to tell and I am listening. 

Open the past and present. 

And the future too. 

It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you. 



Loose ends tied in knots. 

Leaving a lump down in my throat. 

Gagging on a souvenir. 

Lodged to fill another year. 

Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds. 

Leaving myself wide open. 

Living out a sacrifice. 



If you got no one and I've got no place to go, would it be alright? 

Could it be alright?

### She ###
She...
She screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
We...
Wait for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control



Are you locked up in a world

That's been planned out for you?

Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?



Scream at me until my ears bleed

I'm taking heed just for you



She...

She's figured out

All her doubts were someone else's point of view

We...

Walking up this time

To smash the silence with the brick of self-control



Are you locked up in a world

That's been planned out for you?

Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?



Scream at me until my ears bleed

I'm taking heed just for you



EHHHHHH,AHHHHHHHHHH!!!



Are you locked up in a world

That's been planned out for you?

Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?



Scream at me until my ears bleed

I'm taking heed just for you

### St. Jimmy ###
St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette
He's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of 1,2,1,2,3,4!

My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out

Suicide commando that your momma talked about

King of the forty thieves

And I'm here to represent

That needle in the vein of the establishment



I'm the patron saint of the denial

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal



Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope

I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allen Poe

Raised in the city under a halo of lights

The product of war and fear that we've been victimized



I'm the patron saint of the denial

With an angel face and a taste for suicidal



ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?



I'll give you something to cry about.



ST. JIMMY!



My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun 

I'm the one that's from the way outside (St. Jimmy)

I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun

In the cult of the life of crime. (St. Jimmy)



I really hate to say it but I told you so

So shut your mouth before I shoot you down old boy (St. Jimmy)

Welcome to the club and give me some blood

And the resident leader at the lost and found (St. Jimmy)



It's comedy and tragedy

It's St. Jimmy

And that's my nameeeeeee...and don't wear it out!

### Still Breathing ###
I'm like a child looking off on the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
Oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine

Oh, I'm still alive



Am I bleeding? 

Am I bleeding from the storm?

Just shine a light into the wreckage, 

So far away, away



'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way away

'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way away

My way to you



I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time

I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime

Oh, I'm still alive



I'm like a son that was raised without a father

I'm like a mother barely keeping it together

Oh, I'm still alive



Am I bleeding? 

Am I bleeding from the storm?

Just shine a light into the wreckage, 

So far away, away



'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way away

'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way, away, away...



As I walked out on the ledge

Are you scared to death to live?

I've been running all my life

Just to find a home that's for the restless

And the truth that's in the message

Making my way, away, away



'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way away

'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way, away



'Cause I'm still breathing

'Cause I'm still breathing on my own

My head's above the rain and roses

Making my way, away

My way to you

### Stuck with Me ###
I'm not part of your elite
I'm just alright
Class structure waving colors
Bleeding from my throat
Not subserviant to you I'm just alright
Down classed by the powers that be

Give me loss of hope



Cast out... Buried in a hole

Struck down... forcing me to fall

Destroyed... giving up the fight

Well,I know I'm not alright



What's my price and will you pay it if it's alright?

Take it from my dignity

waste it until it's dead

Throw me back into the gutter

'Cause it's alright

Find another pleasure fucker

Drag them down to hell



Cast out... Buried in a hole

Struck down... forcing me to fall

Destroyed... giving up the fight

Well,I know I'm not alright



Cast out... Buried in a hole

Struck down... forcing me to fall

Destroyed... giving up the fight

Well,I know I'm not alright

Standing on the corner of Stuart and the Avenue Ripping up my transfer And a photograph of you You're a blur of my dead past and rotting existance As I stand laughing on the corner of insignificance Destiny is dead In the hands of bad luck Before it might have made some sense But now it's all fucked up Seasons change as well as minds And I'm a two faced clown You're mommy's little nightmare Driving daddy's car around I'm beat down and half brain dead The long lost king of fools I may be dumb But I'm not stupid enough to stay with you

### Take Back ###
you pushed me once too far again,i'd love to break your fucking teeth.stick a knife in the center of your back.you better grow some eyes in the back of your head.i fight dirty, just like your looks.can't take can't takecan't take anymore.take back take back take backthe taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue. an eye for an eye. gun for a gun.cold-cocked and i'm taking back what's mine.expect it when you're least expecting it.no loss of love the smell of regret.lights outcan't take anymore shite

### The Forgotten ###
Where in the world's the forgotten?
They're lost inside your memory
You're dragging on, your heart's been broken
As we all go down in history
Where in the world did the time go?

It's where your spirit seems to roam

Like losing faith to our abandon

Or an empty hallway from a broken home



Well don't look away from the arms of a bad dream

Don't look away, sometimes you're better lost than to be seen



I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted

Another moment trapped in time

I can't quite put my finger on it

But it's like a child that was left behind



So where in the world's the forgotten?

Like soldiers from a long lost war

We share the scars from our abandon

And what we remember becomes folklore



Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream

Don't look away, sometimes you're better lost than to be seen

Don't look away from the arms of a moment

Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow

Don't look away from the arms of a moment

Don't look away from the arms of love



Well, don't look away from the arms of a bad dream

Don't look away, sometimes you're better lost than to be seen

Don't look away from the arms of a moment

Don't look away from the arms of tomorrow

Don't look away from the arms of a moment

Don't look away from the arms of love

### The Grouch ###
I was a young boy that had big plans. 
Now I'm just another shitty old man. 
I don't have fun and I hate everything. 
The world owes me, so fuck you. 
Glory days don't mean shit to me. 

I drank a six pack of apathy. 

Life's a bitch and so am I. 

The world owes me, so fuck you. 



Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals. 

I had a young and optimisitic point of view. 

Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals. 

I had a young and optimisitic point of view. 



I've decomposed, yet my gut's getting fat. 

Oh my god I'm turning out like my dad. 

I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch. 

The world owes me, so fuck you. 



The wife's a nag and the kid's fucking up. 

I don't have sex `cause i can't get it up. 

I'm always rude. 

I've got a bad attitude. 

The world owes, so fuck you.

### The Judge's Daughter ###
Princess in a school girl's dream
May I please speak with you?
I'm having troubles with control
And it's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street

So I look down at my shoes

They were on the wrong feet



I find it hard to be myself

(Can you please explain?)

I do not think that it's my health

(You're the one to blame)

You're the one I wish I had

And now my girlfriend is getting mad

(I cannot call this sane)



Today as I was walking down

You bumped into me

You said "excuse me" and walked away

As I dropped to my knees

I prayed to the being in the sky

That my parents told me of

I asked about you but no reply

No clues about your love!



I find it hard to be myself

(Can you please explain?)

I do not think that it's my health

(You're the one to blame)

My girlfriend left me on the phone

I'm pathetically left here alone

(I cannot call this sane)



Can we find a way

So that you can stay

I think I'm gonna Pop



I find it hard to be myself

(Can you please explain?)

I do not think that it's my health

(You're the one to blame)

You're the one I wish I had

And now my girlfriend is getting mad

(I cannot call this sane)



Can we find a way

So that you can stay

I think I'm gonna Pop

### The One I Want ###
Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I couldn't be near her
'Cause you are the one that started

To make me feel this way

And every night I'm thinking

About the words you'd say



Pictures going through my mind

When we're together

All these long and sleepless nights

Will I ever get better



'Cause you are the one that started

To make me feel this way

And every night I'm thinking

About the words you'd say

'Cause you are THE ONE THAT I WANT



Now you know how I feel

This love is forever

You make my life seem so unreal

Will I ever get better? ...



'Cause you are the one that started

To make me feel this way

And every night I'm thinking

About the words you'd say

'Cause you are THE ONE THAT I WANT

### The Static Age ###
Can you hear the sound of the static noise?
Blasting out in stereo
Cater to the class and the paranoid
Music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion
Murder on the airwaves

Slogans on the brink of corruption

Vision of blasphemy, war and peace

Screaming at you



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age



Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape

Working your insanity

Tragic a'la madness and concrete

Coca-Cola execution

Conscience on a cross and

Your hearts in a vice

Squeezing out your state of mind

Are what you own that you cannot buy

What a fucking tragedy, strategy

Screaming at you.



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age



Hey hey, it's the static age

This is how the west was won

Hey hey, it's the static age millennium



All I want to know

Is a god-damned thing

Not what's in the medicine

All I want to do is

I want to breathe

Batteries are not included

What's the latest way that a man can die

Screaming hallelujah?

Singing out "the dawn's early light"

The silence of the rotten, forgotten

Screaming at you.



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age



I can't see a thing in the video

I can't hear a sound on the radio

In stereo in the static age

The static age

### The Time of Your Life (Good Riddance) ###
Lyrics not found.

### Tight Wad Hill ###
Cheapskate on the hill
A thrill seeker making deals
Sugar city urchin wasting time
Town of lunatics
Begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs

One more night



Making your rounds once again

Turning up empty handed

Bumming a ride

Burning daylight

Last up at dawn... tight wad hill



Drugstore hooligan

Another white trash mannequin

On display to rot up on the hill

Living out a lie

But having the time of his life

Hating every minute of his existance



Making your rounds once again

Turning up empty handed

Bumming a ride

Burning daylight

Last up at dawn... tight wad hill



Making your rounds once again

Turning up empty handed

Bumming a ride

Burning daylight

Last up at dawn... tight wad hill

### Troublemaker ###
Hey!
You're giving me a heart attack
You're giving me a cardiac arrest
When I'm standing at the traffic light
Hey!

I wanna get inside of you

I wanna crack your cranium delirium

On the lower east side of your mind



Wanna be a Troublemaker

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Wanna be a Troublemaker



Hey!

I like your BMW

I like your BM-excellent tits

With a tattoo of a pig sniffing glue



Hey!

You're living at the W

You're looking like a Jezebel, hot as hell

Sunburned in a pink bathing suit



Wanna be a Troublemaker

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Wanna be a Troublemaker

Wanna be a Troublemaker



Hey!



Yeah!



Easy come and go, gonna go it alone

Knock yourself out with a shot of Patron

I wouldn't say I'm straight 'cause I'm bent out of shape

From now till death do we party just before it's too late



Hey!

You're giving me a heart attack

You're giving me a cardiac arrest

When I'm standing at the traffic light



Hey!

### Uptight ###
I woke up on the wrong side of the floor. 
Made, made my way through the front door. 
Broke my engagement with myself. 
Perfect picture of bad health, another notch scratched on my belt. 
The future just ain't what it used to be. 


I got a new start on a dead end road. 

Peaked, peaked out on reaching new lows. 

Owe, I paid off all my debts to myself. 

Perfect picture of bad health, another notch scratched on my belt. 

The future's in my living room. 



Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun. 

All night, suicide's last call. 

I've been uptight all night. 

I'm a son of a gun. 

Uptight I'm a nag with a gun

### Waiting ###
I've been waiting a long time 
For this moment to come        
I'm destined for anything at all 
Downtown lights will be shining 
On me, like a new diamond 

Ring out, under the midnight hour        

Well no one can touch me now 

And I can't turn my back 

It's too late, ready or not at all 



Well I'm so much closer than 

I have ever known...        

Wake up! 



Dawning of a new era 

Calling, don't let it catch ya 

Falling, ready or not at all        

So close, enough to taste it 

Almost I can embrace this 

Feeling, on the tip of my tongue 



Well I'm so much closer than 

I have ever known...        

Wake up! 



You better thank your lucky stars 



Well I'm so much closer than 

I have ever known...        

Wake up! 



You better thank your lucky stars 



I've been waiting a long time 

For this moment to come        

I'm destined for anything at all 



Dumbstruck, colour me stupid 

Good luck, you're gonna need it        

Where I'm going, if I get there at all 



Wake up!        

You better thank your lucky stars!

### Wake Me Up When September Ends ###
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast

Wake me up when September ends



Here comes the rain again

Falling from the stars

Drenched in my pain again

Becoming who we are



As my memory rests

But never forgets what I lost

Wake me up when September ends



Summer has come and passed

The innocent can never last

Wake me up when September ends



Ring out the bells again

Like we did when spring began

Wake me up when September ends



Here comes the rain again

Falling from the stars

Drenched in my pain again

Becoming who we are



As my memory rests

But never forgets what I lost

Wake me up when September ends



Summer has come and passed

The innocent can never last

Wake me up when September ends



Like my father's come to pass

Twenty years has gone so fast

Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends

### Walking Alone ###
Come together like a foot in a shoe 
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth. 
Thinking out loud and acting in vain. 
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way. 
Sometimes I need to apologize. 

Sometimes I need to admit that I ain't right. 

Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut, or only say hello. 

Sometimes I still feel I'm walking alone. 



Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground, yet there's really no one left, that's hanging around. 

Isn't that another familiar face? 

Too drunk to figure out they're fading away.

### Walking Contradiction ###
Do as I say not as I do because
The shit so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet's fat and so is my head

Hit and run and then I'll hit you again

I'm a smart ass but I'm playing dumb



Standards set and broken all the time

Control the chaos behind a gun

Call it as I see it even if

I was born deaf, blind and dumb

Losers winning big on the lottery

Rehab rejects still sniffing glue

Constant refutation with myself

I'm a vicitm of a catch 22



I have no belief

But I believe

I'm a walking contradiction

And I ain't got no right



Do as I say not as I do because

The shit so deep you can't run away

I beg to differ on the contrary

I agree with every word that you say

Talk is cheap and lies are expensive

My wallet's fat and so is my head

Hit and run and then I'll hit you again

I'm a smart ass but I'm playing dumb



I have no belief

But I believe

I'm a walking contradiction

And I ain't got no right



I have no belief

But I believe

I'm a walking contradiction

And I ain't got no right

### Welcome to Paradise ###
Dear mother,
Can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own

And I'm feeling so alone



Pay attention to the cracked streets

And the broken homes

Some call it the slums

Some call it nice

I want to take you through 

a wasteland I like to call 

my home

Welcome To Paradise



A gunshot rings out at the station

Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own

It makes me wonder why I'm still here

For some strange reason it's now

Feeling like my home 

And I'm never gonna go



Pay attention to the cracked streets

And the broken homes

Some call it slums

Some call it nice

I want to take you through 

a wasteland I like to call 

my home

Welcome To Paradise



Dear mother,

Can you hear me laughing

It's been six whole months since 

Since that I have left your home

It makes me wonder why I'm still here

For some strange reason it's now

Feeling like my home 

And I'm never gonna go



Pay attention to the cracked streets

And the broken homes

Some call it the slums

Some call it nice

I want to take you through 

a wasteland I like to call 

my home

Welcome To Paradise

### Westbound Sign ###
Boxed up
All of her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and
A westbound sign
Weighed out

Her choices on a scale

Prevailing nothing made sense

Just transportation and a

Blank decision... 



She's taking off

Taking off...

Taking off...

Taking off...



No time and no copping out

She's burning daylight and petrol

Blacked out the rearview mirror

Heading westward on

Strung out

On confusion road

And ten minute nervous breakdowns

Xanex a beer for thought

And she determined... 



She's taking off

Taking off...

Taking off...

Taking off...



Is it salvation?

Or an escape from discontent?

Will she find her name

In the California cement?

Punched out of the grind

That punched her one too many times...

Is tragedy 2000 miles away?



She's taking off

Taking off...

Taking off...

Taking off...

### Whatsername ###
Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face
But I cant recall the name

Now I wonder how Whatsername has been



Seems that she disappeared without a trace

Did she ever marry 'ol Whatshisface

I made a point to burn all of the photographs

She went away and then I took a different path

I remember the face

But I cant recall the name

Now I wonder how Whatsername has been



Remember, whatever

It seems like forever ago

Remember, whatever

It seems like forever ago



The regrets are useless

In my mind

She's in my head

I must confess

The regrets are useless

In my mind

She's in my head

From so long ago

Go--go--go--



And in the darkest night

If my memory serves me right

I'll never turn back time

Forgetting you, but not the time...

### When I Come Around ###
I heard you crying loud, 
all the way across town
You've been searching for that someone,
and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Don't get lonely now

Dry your whining eyes

I'm just roaming for the moment

Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight

you been thinking about ditching me



No time to search the world around

Cause you know where I'll be found

When I come around



I heard it all before

So don't knock down my door

I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser

to try and slag me down because I know I'm right

So go do what you like

Make sure you do it wise

You may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing

was ever there



You can't go forcing something if it's just 

not right



No time to search the world around

Cause you know where I'll be found

When I come around 

When I come around

### Who Wrote Holden Caulfield? ###
A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you
It's news that I for thought
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
I think that I just forgot
Well it hasn't been the first time

And it sure does drive me mad



There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy

There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy

He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting.

Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting



I shuffle through my mind

To see if I can find

The words I left behind

Was it just a dream that happened long ago?

Oh well...

Never mind.



Well it hasn't been the first time

And it sure does drive me mad



There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy

There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy

He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting.

Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting



There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy

There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy

He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting.

Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting



There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy

There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy

He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting.

Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting

### Why Do You Want Him? ###
I saw you standing alone
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left you
Without a trace
Tears falling out of your eyes

He's living in a disguise

You've been feeling bad for so long

You wonder if it's right or wrong



Why Do You Want Him?

Why Do You Want Him?



Now many days have gone by

And you still just sit there and cry

You're feeling bad for yourself

His memory will always dwell

You're so obsessed with his love

That's why push came to shove

You've been feeling bad for so long

You wonder if it's right or wrong



Why Do You Want Him?

Why Do You Want Him?



Why Do You Want Him?

Why Do You Want Him?



You find a way out...

To throw it all the way

But you can bet...

You got someting to say



Why Do You Want Him?

Why Do You Want Him?



Why Do You Want Him?

Why Do You Want Him?

### Worry Rock ###
Another sentimental argument and bitter love. 
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud. 
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone. 
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride. 
A knocked down dragged out fight. 

Fat lips and open wounds. 

Another wasted night and no one will take the fall. 



Where do we go from here? 

And what did you do with the directions? 

Promise me no dead end streets 

And I'll guarantee we'll have the road.

### X-Kid ###
Hey, little kid
Did you wake up late one day and
You're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your old glory but now it's gone
I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall

Then I crashed, into a wall

Then I fell to pieces on the floor

Now you're sick to death



Bombs away, here goes nothing

The shouting's over

Hey X-Kid, bombs away

Here goes nothing

The shouting's over and out

Over and out again



I once was old enough

To know better, man I was too young to care

Many cares, probably would but

Harvey Wood is dead and gone



You fell in love but then you just fell apart

Like a kick in the head

You're an X-Kid and you never even got started again



Bombs away, here goes nothing

The shouting's over

Hey X-Kid, bombs away

Here goes nothing

The shouting's over and out

Over and out



And you were such a young soul

And you got lost and out of control

You went over the edge of joking

And I have a broken heart



Hey, little kid

Did you wake up late one day and

You're not so young, but you're still dumb

You're an X-Kid and you never even got started again



Bombs away, here goes nothing

The shouting's over

Hey X-Kid, bombs away

Here goes nothing

The shouting's over

Hey X-Kid, bombs away

Here goes nothing

The shouting's over

Hey X-Kid, bombs away

Here goes nothing

The shouting's over and out

Over and out

Over and over and out 



(Merci à Mio pour cettes paroles)

### You Lied ###
You gotta problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taken up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head
Well reality is due What you say just can't be true
When the story is streched and so far fetched

That you're lacking an excuse

You Lied

Your mother allowed you for just one white lie

But now she's dead,and she left you with a problem

Pinocchio has pierced your tongue

Your nose is growin' into the 3rd dimension

Well reality is due What you say just can't be true

When the story is stretched and so far fetched

That you're lacking an excuse

You Lied

Well reality is due What you say just can't be true

When the story is stretched and so far fetched

That you're lacking an excuse

You Lied
