I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Read between the lines
Of what's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone 

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Don't want to be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything
All at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said "My life's a bore"
So quit my whining cause
It's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh, yuh, yuh, ya

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned? 

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life 

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

You and I 

Say hey!
Cha!

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday! (Hey!)

Three, four!
"The representative from California has the floor."

"Sieg Heil" to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass, and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Just 'cause (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday! 


Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends

I heard you crying loud,
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone,
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight
You been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing
Was ever there

You can't go forcing something if it's just
Not right

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around 

A small cloud has fallen
The white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail
The rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red

Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

Laying in my bed
I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close
My body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?

Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

Laying in my bed
I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close
My body begins to swell
Why does one and one make two?

Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
Still I try
No rest for cross-tops in my mind
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My senses dulled
Past the point of delirium
On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room
On my own... here we go 

I text a postcard sent to you
Did it go through?
Sending all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life
Every night
Giving all my love to you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you

With every breath that I am worth
Here on Earth
I'm sending all my love to you
So if you dare to second-guess
You can rest
Assured that all my love's for you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
Did I ever make it through? 

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's a symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody that

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothing comes to mind (Hey!)

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel, and she's dangerous 


[Part I: Jesus of Suburbia]

I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of "none of the above"
On a steady diet of
Soda-pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in Hell
As far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Part II: City of the Damned]

At the center of the Earth, in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says "home is where your heart is," but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care

I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

[Part III: I Don't Care]

I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care!

Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled, but never saved
From the cradles to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia!

Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe
(Said it's, it's another lie!)
And I don't believe

And I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care! (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I don't care!

[Part IV: Dearly Beloved]

Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented, or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

(Ooh, ooh) Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
(Ooh, ooh) Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Part V: Tales of Another Broken Home]

To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I've walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time!

I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken

Home
You're leaving
You're leaving
You're leaving
Are you leaving home? 

Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the living dead is on its way
With a credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope

When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh-oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
Lesson learned to me and you

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed

'Cause I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted

What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed

'Cause I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinking 'bout the only road
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted 

Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming

Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming

Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh, Novacaine

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming

Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me, Jimmy, I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, rah-eh!
Bringing on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
And silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes, say!

Oh-eh-oh-eh!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!

Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, from here to eternity (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, silence is the enemy, so gimme, gimme revolution!

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

(Do you know the enemy?)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
While burning down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
(Do you know the enemy?)
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
So rally up the demons of your soul! (Oh-eh-oh-eh!) 

Dear mother,
Can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Dear mother,
Can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months
Since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Oh, paradise 


It started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneaking through her bedroom door
To find something in a size four

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen?
Don't knock it until you've tried it

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

Sugar and spice and everything nice
Wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose
Is making room for the one and only

King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in the leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me 

Scream! With your hands up in the sky
Like you wanna testify
For the life that's been deleted
Scream! Like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated

We will be seen, but not be heard

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"

(Gimme) Rage! Like there's tear gas in the crowd
Do you wanna live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing
Rise! Of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves
For the anti-social media

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"

We will be seen, but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!" 

[Part I]

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born, and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost, but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Video games through the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost, but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

[Part II]

We are the class of, the class of '13
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

My name is no one, the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised through the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation, a worker of pride (Hey!)
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and a means to an end
It's all that I have to show

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet (Hey!)
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
The freedom to obey
It's the song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line

[Part III]

Oh, dream, America, dream
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream
Believe what you see from heroes and cons 

[Part 1: American Eulogy]

Sing us the song of the century
It sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Of forgotten hope and the class of '13
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me

[Part 2: Mass Hysteria]

Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thought leads to full-throttle screaming
And the wealth is asphyxiating
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And it's creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of

Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf mute's misleading the choir
The punchline is a natural disaster
And it's sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hanging on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar
When he said, "It's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the..."

Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

There's a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
"Mayday, this is not a test"
As the neighborhood burns
America is falling
Vigilantes warning ya
Calling Christian and Gloria!

[Part 3: Modern World]

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

Well, I'm the class of '13 in the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul on a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels without a common ground
I'm gonna light a fire into the underground, well

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it's written, fucking lies

Well, I wanna take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the "up to date" and the neo-gentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system that is falling apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage
Well, I don't give a shit about the modern age

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

Well, people try to put us down
Talkin' bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin' bout my generation
The things they do look awful cold
Talkin' bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation

Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm just talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation

Heineken, fuck that shit!

Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm just talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation

My generation

Talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation 

Somebody keep my balance, I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

I'm taking one step sideways, leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5, hooray, we're gonna die
Blessed into our distinction

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere

Always move forward
Going straight won't get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere, in nowhere 

Come together like a foot in a shoe
Only this time, I think I stuck my foot in my mouth
Thinking out loud and acting in vain
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walking alone

Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground
Yet there's really no one left that's hanging around
Isn't that another familiar face?
Too drunk to figure out they're fading away

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walking alone

Sometimes, I need to apologize
Sometimes, I need to admit that I ain't right
Sometimes, I should just keep my mouth shut
Or only say hello
Sometimes, I still feel I'm walking alone
